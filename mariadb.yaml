    summary: MariaDB Module
    description:  MariaDB is a community developed branch of MySQL. MariaDB is a multi-user, 
                  multi-threaded SQL database server.
                  It is a client/server implementation consisting of a server daemon (mysqld)
                  and many different client programs and libraries. The base package
                  contains the standard MariaDB/MySQL client programs and generic MySQL files.
